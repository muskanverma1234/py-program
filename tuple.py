# TUPLES 
'''
A comma-separated group of items is called a Python triple. The ordering, settled items, and 
reiterations of a tuple are to some degree like those of a rundown, but in contrast to a rundown, 
a tuple is unchanging.

Features of Python Tuple
Tuples are an immutable data type, meaning their elements cannot be changed after they are generated.
Each element in a tuple has a specific order that will never change because tuples are ordered 
sequences.
