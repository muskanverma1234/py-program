Function - A collection of related assertions that carry out a mathematical, analytical, or evaluative
           operation is known as a function. 
advantages of function :
1. Once defined, Python functions can be called multiple times and from any location in a program.
2.Our Python program can be broken up into numerous, easy-to-follow functions if it is significant.
3.The ability to return as many outputs as we want using a variety of arguments is one of Python's most
 significant achievements.
4.However, Python programs have always incurred overhead when calling functions.

syntax:
def function_name(parameters):
